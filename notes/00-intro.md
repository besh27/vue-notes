Comparison with other frameworks

- A virtual dom
- reactive components that offer the View layer only
- props and a Redux-like store similar to react
- conditional rendering and services similar to Angular
- Inspired by polymer for simplicity and performance, Vue offers a similar development style as HTML, styles and JS are composed in tandem. 
- Slightly better performance than React, no use of polyfills like Polymer and an isolated, less opinionated view than Angular, which is an mvc.
